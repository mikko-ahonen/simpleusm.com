### What is Unified Service Management?

Unified Service Management (USM) represents the evolution of IT Service Management (ITSM) to encompass all services across the enterpriseâ€”not just IT. It breaks down silos between departments and creates a cohesive approach to service delivery that aligns with business objectives.

- **Practical Guidance**: Real-world examples and case studies you can apply immediately.
- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Proven frameworks and methodologies for successful USM adoption.
- **Best Practices**: Lessons learned from successful implementations across various industries.

### What Makes SimpleUSM Different?
