## An Introductory Guide to Unified Service Management

**Simple USM** is an introductory e-book about USM, targeted at people who want to understand the basics of USM, for example for deploying USM with the help of a coach.

It explains the core ideas of the USM method in a simple, condensed format. If you wish to gain wider or deeper understanding of the USM Method, for example to deploy USM without the help of a coach, you should refer to the comprehensive book **"The USM Method"**.

### What is Unified Service Management?

Unified Service Management (USM) is a method for Service Management with the following features:

- **Universal** - You can use it to manage any service
- **Unified** - Allows workflows to cooperate harmoniously even in complex networks of service providers
- **Principle-based** - Built on solid principles inspired by best practices, not prescriptive processes
- **Free** - No royalties to pay for using it
- **Simple** - Easy to learn and become self-sufficient
- **Non-redundant** - Avoids duplication of work
- **Open** - Fosters a culture of sharing ideas and practices

### Why USM?

Frameworks and standards, such as ISO 20000-1, COBIT, or ITIL are collections of best practices. USM is built on principles inspired by those practices. Thus USM is complementary to them.

In fact, if you need certifications for your business, USM is probably the fastest, least expensive, least risky, and probably even the most useful way to do it. After you deploy USM, auditors can use a cross-reference from their requirements to the activities in workflows, profiles and other specifications of USM to demonstrate compliancy.

### From Services to Customer-Driven Organizations

Today all businesses are service businesses. For many companies it is not enough to just provide servicesâ€”they need to become **customer-driven** to survive in a competitive market.

This means focusing on long-term relationships with customers, instead of only looking at individual transactions. USM helps organizations evolve through service management maturity levels:

- Technology-driven
- System-driven
- Service-driven
- Customer-driven
- Business-driven

### About the USM Method

The USM Method was developed by SURVUZ Foundation and authored by USM Chief Architect **Jan van Bon**.

Jan has extensive experience in Service Management, including being a member of the ITIL v3 guidance team between 2006-2007. He then became increasingly frustrated with the complexity of popular frameworks, including ITIL and various ISO standards, and started developing a simplified method for service management based on principles with a team of like-minded people. USM is the result of that work.

The USM Method is owned and managed by the SURVUZ Foundation in the Netherlands.
