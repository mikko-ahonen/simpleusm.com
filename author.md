### About Simple USM

Mikko authored **Simple USM** as an introductory guide to Unified Service Management, making the powerful USM method accessible to anyone wanting to understand its core concepts. The book distills the essential principles of USM into a practical, easy-to-follow format.

The e-book was written with copious help from **Jan van Bon**, USM Chief Architect and the original author of the USM Method. Jan's extensive experience—including his role on the ITIL v3 guidance team (2006-2007)—brings deep service management expertise to the collaboration.

Illustrations for the book were created by **Kalle Ahonen**, bringing visual clarity to USM's concepts and workflows.

### Professional Background

With a background spanning technical architecture, product ownership, and executive technology leadership, Mikko brings a unique perspective to service management:

- **Technical Expertise**: Deep understanding of systems, processes, and technology integration
- **Strategic Leadership**: Experience as CTO and Chief Product Owner
- **Customer-Driven Focus**: Commitment to transforming organizations from technology-driven to customer-driven maturity
- **Practical Implementation**: Hands-on consultant helping organizations deploy USM effectively

### USM Coaching Philosophy

> "USM is about making service management simple, practical, and effective. Organizations don't need more complexity—they need clear principles they can actually use."

Mikko's coaching approach focuses on:

1. **Learning, Not Just Doing**: Helping organizations become self-sufficient in USM deployment
2. **Simplicity**: Cutting through complexity to focus on what matters
3. **Customer-Driven Maturity**: Moving beyond technology and systems to true customer focus
4. **Practical Application**: Real workflows and processes that work in your organization

### The USM Method

The USM Method was developed by the SURVUZ Foundation and authored by Jan van Bon. After years of working with complex frameworks like ITIL and ISO standards, Jan and his team created USM as a principle-based alternative that is:

- Universal (works for any service)
- Unified (harmonizes workflows across provider networks)
- Free and open
- Simple and non-redundant
- Complementary to existing frameworks and standards
